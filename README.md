### Dll Injection To Remote Process  
###### *Educational Purposes Only*

Injects Specified Dll to any running specified Remote Process (eg- explorer.exe or notepad.exe)

-- No debug tests are added or reader's understanding and simplicity -- 

The code can be modified to get the dll from staged web server ( In Future i Will update this repo to implement this )


--- UPDATE --- RemoteDllinjection from Web Fetched Dll has been added to Project

Future Update would be to fetch Shellcode from Web & inject in remote process
